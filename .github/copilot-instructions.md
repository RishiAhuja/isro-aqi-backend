# HACKATHON PROJECT: ISRO AQI VISUALIZER & FORECAST APP
  Role: Backend Developer | Assistant: GitHub Copilot

  Objective:
  Build a backend system for a React-based web app that delivers:
  - Real-time AQI from CPCB stations and satellite sources
  - Historical AQI trends over time
  - Predictive AQI forecasts for next 24â€“72 hours
  - Health recommendations based on pollution levels
  - Push notifications when AQI exceeds thresholds
  - (Optional/Bonus): Map of pollution sources like factories or crop burning

  Tech Stack:
  - Node.js + Express (REST API server)
  - Prisma ORM (DB abstraction)
  - PostgreSQL (relational database, dockerized)
  - Docker + docker-compose (for local development)
  - Axios (for external API calls)
  - Firebase Cloud Messaging (for push alerts)
  - Render (final deployment target)

  Folder Structure to Follow:
  - /routes         â†’ Express endpoints
  - /services       â†’ AQI fetching, processing, and logic modules
  - /utils          â†’ Constants, categorization, formatting helpers
  - /docs           â†’ Full API documentation (markdown or json)
  - /prisma         â†’ Prisma schema + migrations
  - /scripts        â†’ Cron/data-ingestion tools

  Responsibilities for Copilot:
  - Help design routes & DB models based on project goals
  - Divide development into a PHASE-BASED roadmap
  - Maintain a checklist at each phase
  - Clearly mark steps that require human input (e.g., API keys, auth)
  - Assist with deployment readiness for Render

  Copilot Prompt Strategy:
  1. Reflect on project description â†’ Suggest core REST endpoints and DB models
  2. For each feature:
     - Define route URL + method
     - Describe input & output JSON
     - Suggest Prisma models to support this feature
     - Note if it requires: External API key Secure credential Manual integration
  3. Create a phase-based roadmap with checklists
  4. Help update `/docs/` with descriptions & sample responses
  5. Add `.env.example` with needed variables (clearly mark human-provided values)
  6. At final stage, configure Render deployment settings (port binding, env vars, DB URL)

PHASE ROADMAP (Checklist Tracking)

ðŸ”¹ Phase 1: Project Bootstrap
[x] Initialize Express + Prisma + Docker + Postgres
[x] Setup `docker-compose.yml` with backend + DB
[x] Define basic schema: AQILog, Location
[x] Connect Prisma to Postgres and migrate
[x] Create `.env.example` with:
      - DATABASE_URL= (Human: Docker Postgres URL)
      - CPCB_API_KEY= (Human)
     - FIREBASE_SERVER_KEY= (Human)

ðŸ”¹ Phase 2: Real-Time AQI + Data Caching
[x] Route: GET /aqi?lat=..&lng=..
[x] Fetch from CPCB API or mock data (Axios)
[x] Cache to DB with timestamp
[x] Handle API failures gracefully
[x] Log live queries to AQILog table

ðŸ”¹ Phase 3: Historical Trends
[x] Route: GET /history?city=..&days=..
[x] Query DB for past AQI values
[x] Aggregate by day/hour

ðŸ”¹ Phase 4: Forecasting Engine
[ ] Route: GET /forecast?city=..
[ ] Call Hugging Face API or local LSTM model
[ ] Format multi-day prediction output
[ ] (Human: Add Hugging Face API token to .env)

ðŸ”¹ Phase 5: Health Advisory
[x] Route: GET /health-advice?aqi=..
[x] Logic based on Indian/WHO AQI breakpoints
[x] Return severity + advice string

ðŸ”¹ Phase 6: Notifications
[ ] Firebase FCM Setup (Human)
[ ] Route: POST /subscribe (optional)
[ ] Server triggers FCM alert on AQI threshold

ðŸ”¹ Phase 7: Deployment on Render
[ ] Prepare `start` script in package.json
[ ] Add `render.yaml` or deploy via dashboard
[ ] Add build/start command (Render expects `npm start`)
[ ] Configure environment variables on Render dashboard (Human)
[ ] Test live API with frontend

 Documentation:
- Every route should be documented in `/backend/docs/`
- Include method, URL, input params, sample response, and error formats

Tips:
- Use Postman to test routes before frontend integration
- Use `prisma studio` (`npx prisma studio`) to debug DB content
- Use `node-cron` to run AQI fetcher every hour (optional)

- Remember to update this roadmap header throughout the build.
- Mark completed tasks with [x] and add new ones as needed
- tell me whereever I need to manually add API keys or credentials
